#1: Scripts reads list of tiff-files, affine-registers 2 neighbouring slices back-to-back and saves the newly registered slices as separate file in a sub-folder (called /REGISTERED; needs to be renamed manually if the code is re-run). This is done using AffineImageReconstruction2Series.
 -> OPTIONALLY: the series of registered slices can be exported as .mha with defined voxel-resolution subsequntly to registration ((done using AffineImageReconstruction2Series+Export)
 
slices_filename_base_pattern firstSliceNumber LastSliceNumber

slices_filename_base_pattern with "6w_DAPI_GFP_aligned%04d.tif"

USAGE OF EXPORT OPTION (set x,y,z spacing and output name):   slices_filename_base_pattern firstSliceNumber LastSliceNumber spacingX spacingY spacingZ outputImageFile

The final codes (AffineImageReconstruction2Series+(Export)) were established as a merge from a Git-code by Luis Ibanez (https://github.com/luisibanez/ImageReconstruction/tree/master/Source/SliceStacking) 
and 2 different ITK-examples (namely SimpleImageReconstruction AND ???
